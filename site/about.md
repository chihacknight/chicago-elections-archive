# About

This site is an open source, volunteer project to make it easier to access the historical results of Chicago elections.

Source code is available on GitHub: [pjsier/chicago-elections-archive](https://github.com/pjsier/chicago-elections-archive)

## Data Issues

There are some inconsistencies in the data, including precincts where the turnout is reported as greater than 100%, as well as some precincts where data is missing. In general, if there are only a few precincts like this the election is still included here.

Several elections were missing too many precinct matches to be usable, so those are not made available here.

Notice something else? Feel free to send an email to [info@chicagoelectionsarchive.org](mailto:info@chicagoelectionsarchive.org)

## Data Access

Elections results for elections going back to 2000 are available from the [Chicago Board of Election Commissioners website](https://chicagoelections.gov/en/election-results.html).

Election results for some earlier historic elections (some of which are not displayed here) are available from the [Chicago Elections Project](https://data.lib.vt.edu/articles/dataset/Chicago_Elections_Project/14099084).

All precinct boundaries can be accessed through DataMade's open source project: [datamade/chicago-municipal-elections](https://github.com/datamade/chicago-municipal-elections)
